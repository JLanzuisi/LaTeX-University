        This document was typeset using \LuaTeX%
        \footnote{%
            \TeX\ is
            a typesetting software, free and open source,
            developed by Donald Knuth. \LaTeX\ is a macro
            set for \TeX\ developed by Leslie Lamport. \LuaTeX\ is
            a reworking of \TeX\ adding native support for the Lua
            programming language and unicode, among other things.
            All of them are available in all major
            operating systems.

        and the \LaTeXe\ macros in a Linux operating system.
        The editor used for editing the text was Geany%
        \footnote{%
            Geany is a text editor, halfway between an IDE
            and a more traditional text editor.
            It is free software, fast, and lightweight.
            It provides \LaTeX\ syntax highliting.
            The \texttt{latexmk} tool was used along side it
            to compile the document.

        The main typeface used is the Computer Modern family%
        \footnote{%
            Specifically, the New Computer Modern family,
            which is a new opentype version of the original
            typefaces. It bundles a new slightly darker ``book"
            weight, complete Cyrillic, many new glyphs, 
            and some more improvements.
        }
        for text and New Computer Modern Math for math%
        \footnote{%
            In \LuaLaTeX\ this amounts to using the following:
            \mintinline{latex}|\usepackage[default]{fontsetup}|
        }.
