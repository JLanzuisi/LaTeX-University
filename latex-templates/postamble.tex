            \TeX\ is
            a typesetting software, free and open source,
            developed by Donald Knuth. \LaTeX\ is a macro
            set for \TeX\ developed by Leslie Lamport. \LuaTeX\ is
            a reworking of \TeX\ adding native support for the Lua
            programming language and unicode, among other things.
            All of them are available in all major
            operating systems.

        The editor used for editing the text was \TeX Maker%
        \footnote{%
            \TeX Maker (Â©2003--2021 Pascal Brachet)
            is a \LaTeX\ editor closer to an IDE than to,
            say, vi or emacs.

        The main typeface used is the Computer Modern family%

            typefaces. It bundles a new slightly darker "book"
            weight, complete Cyrillic, many new glyphs, 
            and some more improvements.

        for text and New Computer Modern Math for math%

            In \LuaLaTeX\ this amounts to using the following:
