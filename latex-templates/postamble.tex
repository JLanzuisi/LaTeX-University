        This document was typeset using \TeX%
        \footnote{%
            \TeX\ is
            a typesetting software, free and open source,
            developed by Donald Knuth. \LaTeX\ is a macro
            set for \TeX\ developed by Leslie Lamport. \LuaTeX\ is
            a reworking of \TeX\ adding native support for the Lua
            programming language and unicode, among other things.
            All of them are available in all major
            operating systems.
        }
        and the \LaTeXe\ macros in a Linux operating system.
        The editor used for editing the text was vi%
        \footnote{%
            vi is the standard text editor in UNIX-like
						operating systems. It has had a cuople of versions
						trought the years, the current most popular is vim
						(vi improved). The version of vi used here is
						nvi.
        }.
        The main typeface used is the Computer Modern family%
        \footnote{%
						The computer modern family, designed by Donald Knuth,
						is the default \TeX\ typeface. It is based on the
						Monotype Modern typeface, and shares a lot of similarities
						with said font and with other Modern fonts used in
						mathematical typesetting before Times Roman came along.
        }
        for text and for math%
        \footnote{%
            In \LaTeX\ this amounts to using the following package:
            \texttt{unicode-math}.
