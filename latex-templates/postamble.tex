This document was typeset using \TeX%
\footnote{%
    \TeX\ is
    a typesetting software, free and open source,
    developed by Donald Knuth. \LaTeX\ is a macro
    set for \TeX\ developed by Leslie Lamport. \LuaTeX\ is
    a reworking of \TeX\ adding native support for the Lua
    programming language and unicode, among other things.
    All of them are available in all major
    operating systems.
}
and the \LaTeXe\ macros in a Windows PC.
The editor used for editing the text was Visual Studio Code%
\footnote{%
    Visual Studio Code is a text editor by Microsoft
    that is open source. With it's many extensions, it is somewhere between
    a classic text editor and an IDE. The LaTeX Workshop extension was
    specially useful in producing this document.
}.
The main typeface used is the Computer Modern family%
\footnote{%
    The computer modern family, designed by Donald Knuth,
    is the default \TeX\ typeface. It is based on the
    Monotype Modern typeface, and shares a lot of similarities
    with said font and with other Modern fonts used in
    mathematical typesetting before Times Roman came along.
}
for text and for math%
\footnote{%
    In \LaTeX\ this amounts to using the following package:
    \texttt{unicode-math}.
}.
